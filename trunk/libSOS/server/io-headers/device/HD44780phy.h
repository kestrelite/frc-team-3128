 * exposing to the higher layer only 8-bit interface.
 * The implementation must honor multiple chip select (enable) lines, for displays with multiple HD44780 chips on board.
 * All requests to chips with indexes beyond the number of supported enable lines should be ignored.
 *
 * The class should not be use to drive multiple displays connected to the data and control bus, unless they are
 * supposed to act as one composite display.
 * To drive multiple independent displays sharing data and control bus each display, each display should have a separate
 * instance of HD44780phy object, controlled by separate blocks of IO lines sharing the data and control lines, with
 * different enable lines.
