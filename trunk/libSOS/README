libSOS is the serial interface between the networked linux boards attatched to the sensors and camera and the cRIO.
It runs on a Beaglebone Black connected via SPI with certian SPI drivers installed (copy the ./server/io-drivers folder to the device and run the installer script).

FYI, libSOS stands for libSerial-Over-Socket
