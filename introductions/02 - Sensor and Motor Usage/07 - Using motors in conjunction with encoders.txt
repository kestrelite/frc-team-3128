GOAL: Properly use raw encoders and their angles
-----

DETAILS: AbstractEncoder is an abstract class which has two required functions: getAngle() and getRawValue(). There are two existing implementations: GyroEncoder and MagneticPotEncoder. 

There is a function in frc3128.Util.RobotMath called normalizeAngle(); this function must be invoked on all angle values continuously, as it keeps the angle values to within normal range. We keep track of angles from 0 to 360 degrees.
-----

TASK: Create a new MotorLink using a MagneticPotEncoder. Read out the angle, and print the normalized value to the print stream.
-----

SUCCESS:
  1) Create a MotorLink and associated AbstractEncoder and Jaguar
  2) The AbstractEncoder and Jaguar are fully consumed by the MotorLink
  3) The angle from the MotorLink is normalized and printed out
  4) The print out uses DebugLog
