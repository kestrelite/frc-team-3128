GOAL: Create an encoder and read out its angle
-----

DETAILS:

TASK: Encoders are devices which keep track of the angle of a given motor. The MotorLink class can be linked with an AbstractEncoder.

Create a MagneticPotEncoder and print out its raw angle on teleop init.
-----

SUCCESS:
  1) Only the MagneticPotEncoder is kept as a static resource
  2) The raw angle is printed out using DebugLog at the appropriate level
