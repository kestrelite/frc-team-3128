GOAL: Declare sensors and use their values
-----

DETAILS: Sensors are primarily accessible through the frc3128.HardwareLink package. For instance, a gyroscope will use the GyroLink package for communications. 

GyroLink consumes a Gyroscope in its constructor.
-----

TASK: Declare a new GyroLink as a static Global resource. Print its value on teleop init.
-----

SUCCESS:
  1) The GyroLink is declared properly
  2) The Gyroscope is consumed by the GyroLink constructor
  3) The value of the gyro is printed out when the robot initializes
