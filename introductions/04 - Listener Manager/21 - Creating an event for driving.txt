GOAL: Create an event for driving
-----

DETAILS: Drive events are not iterable events; instead, they are registered with ListenerManager and are called when controller updates occur. 
-----

TASK: Create a Drive event which runs on UPDATE_DRIVE and will set the power of a motLeft motor to the value of the Y axis on joystick 1. The drive event should also set the power of a motRight motor to the value of the Y axis on joystick 2.
