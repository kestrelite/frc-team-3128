GOAL: Learn the use of DebugLog to write outputs to the console
-----

DETAILS: One should never use "System.out.print*" to print console outputs. The reasons are varied, but primarily, the outputs become cluttered, unreadable, and generally unusable. 

The benefit to DebugLog is that it enforces three things:
  1) Log message severity, which can be filtered (which is useful for obvious reasons)
  2) Log message timestamps, which do not normally come with system outs
  3) Log message sources, which show where a message actually came from. This is critically important when diagnosing software issues.

The RobotTemplate class is actually what's run by the FRC software, and it interfaces with the Global class. You should never modify the RobotTemplate class.

Bear in mind, there is a critical difference between the DEBUG and STREAM levels: Debug is to be used for individual debugging messages. Stream is to be used for messages which would otherwise flood the console, but are useful for low-level debugs (like controller positions, or event triggering, etc.)

TASK: Write one output of each severity level to the console when teleop starts, in order, using the DebugLog class.
-----

SUCCESS:
  1) Each output is written to the console successfully
  2) No file has been modified except for the Global class
  3) Only the initializeTeleop function in the Global class has been modified
  4) No System.out.* files are used
