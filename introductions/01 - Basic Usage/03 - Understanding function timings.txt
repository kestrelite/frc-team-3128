GOAL: Understand when the initialization functions are called in game
-----

DETAILS: The RobotTemplate class controls the timings in the Global class. You need to understand when and under which circumstances the functions in the Global class would be invoked.

 - initializeRobot     : invoked once when the robot's code starts up
 - initializeDisabled  : invoked once when the robot enters the disabled state before and after the game
 - initializeAutonomous: invoked once when the robot's autonomous phase is about to begin
 - initializeTeleop    : invoked once when the robot's teleoperated phase is about to begin

Every robot task in-game will be handled by the EventManager. The initialization functions are only used to set up the EventManager's sequencing so that everything else follows suit and makes sense.

 - robotKill is a predefined function which you can invoke when you wish to shut off the robot entirely
 - robotStop is a function you can define which turns off the robot without disconnecting or disabling it
